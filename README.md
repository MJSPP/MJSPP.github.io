## Hello There


### I’m Jun, which is short for Kwon Junhyuk. I'm currently an international student studying abroad at [Hokkaido University](https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/), located in Sapporo, the largest city in Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, under the university's [Modern Japanese Studies Program](https://www.oia.hokudai.ac.jp/mjsp/), a 4 year bachelor's program for overseas students.


**A fun fact about Hokkaido University**: every heard of [Keiteki-ryo](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%81%B5%E8%BF%AA%E5%AF%AE)? This is a historic, student-run dormitory for students of Hokkaido University. The current building, shaped like a 8 pointed star, was built in the 1983 as a spiritual successor to the original Keiteki-ryo, which was built in 1876 and demolished shortly after the new dorm was built.
